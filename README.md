# SE302 - Exam Management System

## Project Overview

This is a desktop application developed as part of the SE302 Software Engineering course. The system is designed to streamline and automate the management of examination schedules, ensuring efficient allocation of resources while preventing conflicts.

## Purpose

The Exam Management System aims to solve common challenges faced by educational institutions during examination periods by:
- Managing multiple classes and examination schedules
- Optimizing time slot allocation for exams
- Preventing student scheduling conflicts (collision detection)
- Ensuring fair exam distribution across different time periods
- Reducing administrative workload in exam planning

## Key Features

### Planned Features
- **Class Management**: Register and manage multiple classes and courses
- **Exam Scheduling**: Create and organize exam schedules with date and time allocation
- **Conflict Detection**: Automatic detection of scheduling conflicts for students enrolled in multiple courses
- **Collision Avoidance**: Intelligent algorithm to prevent students from having overlapping exams
- **Time Optimization**: Efficient distribution of exams across available time slots
- **Student Management**: Track student enrollments and exam assignments
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on exam schedules and potential conflicts
