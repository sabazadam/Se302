# SE302 - Exam Management System

## Overview

SE302 is a desktop application designed to streamline exam management across multiple classes. The system helps educational institutions efficiently manage exam scheduling while preventing student collusion and optimizing resource allocation.

## Project Description

This application is developed as part of the SE302 (Software Engineering) course project. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing exam systems with the following key objectives:

- **Multi-Class Management**: Handle exams across various classes and courses
- **Time Optimization**: Intelligent scheduling to avoid conflicts and maximize resource utilization
- **Collision Prevention**: Automatic detection and prevention of student schedule collisions
- **Student Safety**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent academic dishonesty and ensure exam integrity

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Exam Scheduling**
  - Create and manage exam schedules across multiple classes
  - Automated conflict detection for students enrolled in multiple courses
  - Time slot optimization to prevent overlapping exams
  
- **Class Management**
  - Organize exams by class, course, and department
  - Track student enrollment across different classes
  - Manage instructor assignments and room allocations

- **Collision Avoidance**
  - Detect scheduling conflicts before they occur
  - Identify students with overlapping exam times
  - Suggest alternative time slots to resolve conflicts

- **Resource Management**
  - Classroom and venue allocation
  - Exam duration tracking
  - Capacity management to prevent overcrowding
