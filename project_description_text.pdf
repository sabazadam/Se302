( Dear all, this is the video that I have been recording for the description of SE302 course. Throughout the) Tj
T* (semester you will try to put there the corresponding requirements, from this video at least, as well as the) Tj
T* (design and implementation you will handle. The project description is as follows. I would like you to submit) Tj
T* (me a desktop application that helps me create a schedule for the exam interval. You know that you will have) Tj
T* (the corresponding midterm exams in the next coming weeks. So suppose that you have a kind of fixed.) Tj
T* (number of days as a kind of exam time interval and you have a fixed number of classrooms in the schools) Tj
T* (and you have a fixed number of courses And in these courses, you have a fixed number of students) Tj
T* (registered. These fixed numbers are, by the way, available now. The Student Affairs will try to schedule the) Tj
T* (exam period. But here I give you such a kind of sample data to understand the details. For example, we have) Tj
T* (the students in the system with their IDs, say, SDD ID 001 through Here, 250 students, and here we have the) Tj
T* (sample data for the courses. We have 20 courses for the Department of Computer Engineering, you might) Tj
T* (mention it. And here we have the corresponding classrooms in the school to be assigned within the slots of) Tj
T* (the exam period for each exam. we have the corresponding number of the seats, the capacities in the) Tj
T* (classrooms. For this sample data, I suppose that each classroom contains 40 seats and hereby each course) Tj
T* (will have the number of 40 students equally registered in the corresponding example that's just a kind of) Tj
T* (sample you might use such a kind of different classrooms with different number of capacities and by the way) Tj
T* (you might use such different number of course here there are 20 courses for each course there might be) Tj
T* (different number of students registered as well so these all students and all courses are just an example And) Tj
T* (here the Student Affairs will use basically the sample data for the classrooms with their capacities and the) Tj
T* (sample data for the course codes with their registered students. You at least need these two files. And it will) Tj
T* (be a kind of Windows application and desktop application because I am in the role of student affairs, I am) Tj
T* (your customer, I will use the system and nobody else. So that's just the kind of desktop application adequate) Tj
T* (for me. By the way, I need of course some help menus in the application. I as a student affairs, I mean) Tj
T* (authority, will import the corresponding files into the application. These files will contain at least the) Tj
T* (corresponding course codes with their registered students and the corresponding classrooms with their) Tj
T* (capacities. And the program will give the following output. An exam schedule. That's all. So, hereby, the) Tj
T* (create these files and import into your system. They don't need to manually enter these into your system.) Tj
T* (Okay, if you make them do this, okay, but not necessary. These student affairs will import these files. If they) Tj
T* (wanna change these files, okay, they will change the file and then they can re-import. So which means that) Tj
T* (these data should be created, edited, or in a way maybe removed and re-imported. So here we have the) Tj
T* (option as a student affairs authority, I have the option to change the data and re-import the file and rerun the) Tj
T* (program as well. What will be the display result? Say, for each classroom, I would like to see the) Tj
T* (corresponding exams of the courses. For each student, I would like to see the corresponding exam schedule.) Tj
T* (For each course, I would like to see the exact time for each assigned exam. And it's, of course, assigned) Tj
T* (classroom as well. For each day, I would like to see the exams in each slot. Hereby, there are two constraints) Tj
T* (at least. No two consecutive slots shall be assigned for the same student. So if I have such a number of) Tj
T* (exams in a day, there I need a break at least in between. And the next second constraint is the number of) Tj
T* (exams in a day to be assigned for a student is, at most exits. So the number of exams in a day to be) Tj
T* (assigned for a student shall not exceed two, okay? You can also add some more constraints as well. These) Tj
T* (are the necessities. So you will try to at least state the requirements at first and you will design later. By the) Tj
T* (way, if you have any questions further, of course you can ask anytime, remember. So hereby, let's say, This is) Tj
T* (the way that you would use for the exam period. Of course there might be some different alternatives. For) Tj
T* (example, you can follow a kind of greedy algorithm. There might be no solution, so you might need to release) Tj
T* (some constraints. Suppose that the number of the days for the period is 5, let's suppose, and you have four) Tj
T* (slots in a day, again exception, and you are not able to put the resolution for five days, including four slots in a) Tj
T* (day, for such a number of exams to be held. So what should you do? Then you shall either say there is no) Tj
T* (solution or which is not the best, you might put there some other slots in some days. Just an assumption to) Tj
T* (release a constraint. Or for a student you might just consider doing something as like, releasing its constraint) Tj
T* (like, no consecutive two exams will be there. Or in a way you can extend the number of days in the interval.) Tj
T* (So what you cannot change is amongst these alternatives, you cannot change the first constraint. No two) Tj
T* (consecutive slots shall be assigned for a student. And the second constraint, the number of exams in a day to) Tj
T* (be assigned for a student shall not exceed two. Okay, so you can, for example, optimization, not a must, but if) Tj
T* (you have a solution, will it be the best? No, I need a solution, but how would you optimize it? For example,) Tj
T* (you might balance, share the exams within the interval, let's say exam period, equally. Or you might try to) Tj
T* (complete the exams within the minimum number of days, another one, or one other alternative, you might) Tj
T* (use a minimum number of classrooms or a balanced number of classrooms per day, or assigning the very) Tj
T* (crowded courses or assigning the important or assigning the difficult courses to be held for their exams at the) Tj
T* (beginning or at the end of the corresponding interval. It's up to you. Okay, so in the classroom, I will welcome) Tj
T* (your any other further question as well.) Tj
